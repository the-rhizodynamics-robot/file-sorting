-images stored on computer-images sorted on computer or vm-images are sorted, movie made, and stabilized.

-external process to zip, transfer, and unzip

sort, check if folder in in_progress exists.   
  -if so, add to it   
  -if not, make video, stabilize, and clean up (zip images)


Next steps:
-log into VM and get maybe 3 zips? successive runs with overlaping and non-overlapping boxes (at least get one), also get models (qr and seed)... I think that's all.
-Parameterize NF script.
-work on the rotation thing.
