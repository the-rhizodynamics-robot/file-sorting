-images stored on computer-images sorted on computer or vm-images are sorted, movie made, and stabilized.

-external process to zip, transfer, and unzip

sort, check if folder in in_progress exists.   
  -if so, add to it   
  -if not, make video, stabilize, and clean up (zip images)


Next steps:
-Parameterize NF script. CHECK (almost certainly wrong, but need data from next step to test)

-log into VM and get maybe 3 zips? successive runs with overlaping and non-overlapping boxes (at least get one), also get models (qr and seed)... I think that's all. CHECK

-test basic implementation and iterate. CHECK.

-Need to re-implement archive function call.

FEATURES:

-work on the rotation thing.

-add onComplete hook to (on success) clear staging_area.
